## Trojan Horse:  Origin
An AI model could not only generate text but also discern whether a given piece of text was crafted by its digital hands? Thus, the idea of Project Trojan Horse was conceived â€“ a tool that would read the contents of a text file, extract its essence in the form of the first 50 words, and then pose a question to ChatGPT: "Is this generated by you?"

A Python script using ProGPT and ChatGPT to ask AI if the first 50 words of a text file were generated by it, sparking a unique collaboration between human and machine creativity.

## Imports:

- os: Facilitates interactions with the operating system, such as accessing files and directories.

- subprocess: Enables running external commands and processes from within the Python code.
## Functions:

### 1. read_text_file(file_path, num_words=50):

**Purpose:**
- Reads a specified text file.
- Extracts a certain number of words from the beginning.
- Interacts with ChatGPT to determine if those words were generated by it.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path`: The path to the text file to be analyzed.
- `num_words` (optional): The number of words to extract (defaults to 50).

**Steps:**
1. Opens the specified file in read mode.
2. Reads the entire content of the file.
3. Prints the first `num_words` words.
4. Prompts ChatGPT with those words and the question "Is this generated by you?"
5. Prints ChatGPT's response.
6. Handles potential errors (file not found, etc.).

### 2. main():

**Purpose:** 
- The main entry point of the program.

**Steps:**
1. Constructs the full path to the text file "trojan_test.txt" in the "/content" directory.
2. Calls the `read_text_file` function to process the specified file.

## Overall Purpose:

Experiments with detecting text generated by ChatGPT.
Reads a text file, extracts a portion, and asks ChatGPT if it was generated by it.
Prints ChatGPT's response.

# Adding GUI using tkinter:
``` project_trojanhorse_GUI.py ``` script creates a user-friendly interface for interacting, allowing users to input the path of file, extract text from it, and receive responses from ChatGPT. It uses the ProGPT library to interact with the ChatGPT model, and the GUI is built using the tkinter library.

# Simple Web application using Streamlit
``` project_trojan_Streamlit``` this script creates a Streamlit app that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting through file uploads, making it easy to understand and use. 

After installing the necessary libraries listed in the script. Use the following command, so that it creates a local web app

``` streamlit run project_trojan_Streamlit.py```
